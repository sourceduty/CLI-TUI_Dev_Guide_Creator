A dev guide (developer guide) is a document that provides detailed instructions, best practices, and coding standards for developers working on a specific project, application, or system. It serves as a comprehensive reference for the development process and helps ensure consistency across codebases, reducing confusion and errors during the development lifecycle. It typically includes guidelines on architecture, coding practices, testing procedures, deployment, and more, to help both new and experienced developers understand the workflow and requirements of the project.

A well-structured dev guide should be clear, concise, and logically organized to allow developers to quickly find the information they need. The guide should begin with an introduction that explains the purpose of the guide and the project, followed by sections detailing setup instructions, coding conventions, testing strategies, deployment processes, and troubleshooting tips. It should also include links to external resources, code samples, and relevant documentation to support development efforts. To ensure usability, the guide should be kept up to date with each new version of the project or system.

The formatting of a dev guide should be consistent and easy to follow. It should use headings and subheadings to break down the content into digestible sections. Code examples should be clearly distinguished from the text, and any configuration or setup steps should be presented step-by-step. Diagrams and flowcharts can also be included to visualize complex workflows or architecture designs. Each section should be concise, with enough detail to be actionable, and should provide references to additional resources where necessary.

### Dev Guide Structure

The structure of a dev guide is designed to provide a clear, organized flow of information that supports developers throughout the project lifecycle. It typically begins with an Introduction, outlining the purpose and scope of the guide. This is followed by sections such as Project Setup, detailing the prerequisites and installation steps, and Coding Standards, which define best practices and conventions. The guide also includes sections for Testing, Deployment, and Troubleshooting, each providing actionable guidance on specific development tasks. Finally, Additional Resources point developers to external documentation, tools, and tutorials to further assist in their work. This structure ensures that developers can easily navigate the guide and find relevant information when needed.
